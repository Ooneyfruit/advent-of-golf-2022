# Solution requirements
- Solution has to return a function. The returned function must contain parsing logic of the text input and should return the output.<br/>
- Solution, given an input, must run with the correct returned output on a **Lua 5.4** interpreter in the format of `part1, part2`.<br/>
- Any change in the order of the return values must be described in a comment in the code, which characters will not count.<br/>
# Input requirements
- The input to the solution function is a text mode input, so the solution function must be adapted for text mode input.<br/>
- All line endings in the input string must be `\n`.<br/>
- Any changes to the expected input line endings or expected input format in the solution must be clarified with a comment in the solution file.<br/>

Command line runner: `./runner.lua {<day_number>}`
