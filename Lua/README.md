# Solution requirements
Solution has to return a function. Function must contain parsing logic of the input and should return the output.<br/><br/>
Solution, given an input, must run with the correct returned output on a **Lua 5.4** interpreter in the format of `part1, part2`. Any change in the order of the return values must be described in a comment in the code, which characters will not count.
# Input requirements
The input must be a string. All line endings in the input string must be `\n`. Any changes to the expected input line endings or expected input format in the solution must be clarified with a comment.<br/>
