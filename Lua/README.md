Solution has to return a function. Function must contain parsing logic of the input and should return the output.<br/>
All line endings in the input string must be `\n`.<br/>
Solution, given an input, must run with the correct returned output on a Lua 5.4 compiler in the format of `part1, part2`. Any change in the order of the return values must be described in a comment in the code, which characters will not count.
