# Advent of Golf 2022

Code golf solutions for Advent of Code 2022

This repo aims to serve as a central repository of golfed (i.e. as short as possible solutions) Advent of Code 2022 solutions.

## Submitting solutions

To submit a solution for your language, just submit a pull request. If your language does not yet have a folder, feel free to make one! Please try to define rules that are as similar to those of Python or Rust as possible 
(i.e. reading input should be part of the runner, not the solutions; any form of expression allowed by the language can be extracted via a function)

When adding a solution, please *do not* delete previous solutions; prefer shadowing them, or, if the language does not allow that, renaming the previous solution (e.g. to the hash of its original commit)

## Solution format

Solution format will vary by language. See `[language name]/README.md` for information for your language.
