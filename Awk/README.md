# Rules for Awk submissions

Solutions should be single-file programs taking input, without trailing newlines, from stdin and giving two answers separated by whitespace (`' '` or `'\n'`) on stdout. Solutions should not provide unrelated output (e.g. logging, spurious blank lines).

Run this as `./runner.sh <day_number>`.
