# Rules for Python submissions

Solutions should be single-file programs taking input, without trailing newlines, from stdin (`open(0)`) and giving two answers separated by whitespace (`' '` or `'\n'`) on stdout (`print`). Solutions should not provide unrelated output (e.g. logging, spurious blank lines).
